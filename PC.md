**Please uninstall any uniform packs when using this mod. We will fix this in the future, but using uniform packs with our mod can cause issues with uniforms appearing correctly.**

Your PC mod download will automatically install a roster named **VIKES_CFBR**. This roster is optimized for the College Football Revamped Mod and designed to provide you with the best experience. Special thanks to Vikesfan and his team for making great rosters year after year over on the Operation Sports forums.

[The latest roster updates can be found here.](https://forums.operationsports.com/forums/ncaa-football-rosters/964552-ncaa-football-14-2020-2021-roster-update.html)

###### These instructions are for use with a disc copy of the game contents of NCAA Football 14 (game ID BLUS31159).

1) Before using the mod, you must install RPCS3. You can find the [quickstart guide to set up the emulator here](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart). If you have any questions about RPCS3 in general such as good settings to use, feel free to ask in the [official RPCS3 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Af7H9yp).
2) If you have set up RPCS3 before, delete your `games.yml` file in your RPCS3 folder. If you are setting up RPCS3 for the first time, you can skip this step.
3) Make sure your game folder is named **EXACTLY** `BLUS31159-[NCAA Football 14]` or else the Easy Installer will not work. Then, open up your RPCS3 folder and place your game folder in `dev_hdd0/disc/`. The result should look exactly like this when you open your game folder:

4) Next, [download the Easy Installer PKG file from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSJU_ObrwUiTk6EA1R-fNPqVYM7PBMKa/view?usp=sharing).
5) Finally, simply launch RPCS3 and drag the PKG file you just downloaded into the main RPCS3 window. It will take a few minutes to install. You will know it worked if the game icon changes to a CFBR logo and [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/JGcJmNB.png). After that, launch the game and enjoy the mods!

Then place your RAP (license) files in `dev_hdd0/home/00000001/exdata`. If any of this is confusing to you, make sure you have followed the [RPCS3 guide to get your game PKG and license files](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Dumping_PlayStation_3_games#Dumping_PSN_games).
