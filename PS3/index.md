## Please uninstall any uniform packs when using this mod
- We will fix this in the future, but for now, using uniform packs with our mod may cause issues with uniforms appearing correctly.

## Rosters
For the best experience, download the latest roster from **K-Weezy-8**. This roster is specifically designed and optimized for the College Football Revamped Mod. Special thanks to Vikesfan and his team for making great rosters year after year over on the Operation Sports forums.
