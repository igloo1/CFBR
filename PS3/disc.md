### Prerequisites:
- PS3 console (any model)
- USB drive (8 GB or larger)
- Some kind of computer (any Windows PC, Mac, or even Chromebook will work)
- Either a phsical game disc or a copy of the game files

Everything here is only needed for first time setup, aside from the console itself of course.

## PS3 (Disc Copy) Download Instructions:
1) Follow [this great YouTube guide to install HEN and multiMAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOKemRHAZ3c) on your PS3. It should only take 30 minutes to an hour. **YOU CAN SKIP THE OPTIONAL STEP from 13:17-14:29**.
2) Start up your PS3 console and click the "Enable HEN" button (if it fails try again until it works). Then place your game disc in your console and launch the multiMAN application you installed earlier. 
3) Now, hover over the NCAA 14 icon and hit Triangle. A menu will pop up. Click copy, then click `PS3 HDD (/dev_hdd0)`. It will probably ask you "Do you want to copy the game from BD-ROM to internall HDD?". Select "yes".
4) This should take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to copy all the files over. Once it is done, you can click Square to continue. Then eject your disc (you will never need your disc again, you can keep it in the case forever) and quit out of multiMAN. If you got an error saying the process was aborted, please clean your disc and try again. 
5) Move over to your computer and download both [**PART A**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fE0pmqJT-WBmQgs7lo6Ejbiv90f8YTll/view?usp=sharing) and [**PART B**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zkbzUV4XnslOxmI8ubNNJAtdEJfGCAqP/view?usp=sharing) of the V2 Easy Installer. Drag and drop both files onto the root of your USB drive (this means they should not be inside any folder).
6) Plug your USB drive into your PS3, navigate to the game tab on the main menu, scroll down to the bottom, and open the "Package Manager". Then click "Install Package Files". Then click "Standard". You should now see files called `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V3 Part A.pkg` and `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V3 Part B.pkg`. Select Part A and wait for it to finish installing, then select Part B and wait for that to finish installing. Please note, Part A will take longer than Part B.
7) Once both parts are finished installing, you can remove the USB drive. **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY EJECTED YOUR GAME DISC**. Now launch multiMAN. Simply launch the game by pressing X. It will kick you back out to the main PS3 menu, but you wil see a disc icon even though there is no disc inserted. Simply click on that disc icon and it will launch NCAA 14 with our mods installed!
