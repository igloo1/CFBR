## Installation Guide
You **DO NOT** need V1 of the Easy Installer or any other mods installed before using V2 of the Easy Installer. Please click on the link below to jump to the appropriate instructions for your version of the game:

Please uninstall any uniform packs when using this mod. We will fix this in the future, but using uniform packs with our mod can cause issues with Tennessee and Texas A&M uniforms appearing incorrectly. Also, please download the latest roster from **sean15012** on PS3 or **OutrunFire0290** on XBOX for the best experience. PC users will automatically have a roster called **VIKES_CFBR** installed when they install the mod. Special thanks to Vikesfan and his team for making great rosters year after year over on the Operation Sports forums.

## PC (Disc Copy) <img width="40" src="https://i.redd.it/g5476jkjqgh31.jpg"> 
###### These instructions are for use with a disc copy of the game contents of NCAA Football 14 (game ID BLUS31159).

1) Before using the mod, you must install RPCS3. You can find the [quickstart guide to set up the emulator here](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart). If you have any questions about RPCS3 in general such as good settings to use, feel free to ask in the [official RPCS3 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Af7H9yp).
2) If you have set up RPCS3 before, delete your `games.yml` file in your RPCS3 folder. If you are setting up RPCS3 for the first time, you can skip this step.
3) Make sure your game folder is named **EXACTLY** `BLUS31159-[NCAA Football 14]` or else the Easy Installer will not work. Then, open up your RPCS3 folder and place your game folder in `dev_hdd0/disc/`. The result should look exactly like this when you open your game folder:

4) Next, [download the Easy Installer PKG file from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSJU_ObrwUiTk6EA1R-fNPqVYM7PBMKa/view?usp=sharing).
5) Finally, simply launch RPCS3 and drag the PKG file you just downloaded into the main RPCS3 window. It will take a few minutes to install. You will know it worked if the game icon changes to a CFBR logo and [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/JGcJmNB.png). After that, launch the game and enjoy the mods!

### **ONLY USE THIS IF YOU BOUGHT THE GAME ON THE PSN STORE!!! IF YOU ARE UNSURE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY USE THE DISC INSTALLER [HERE](https://github.com/cfbrevamped/CFBR-Easy-Installer#pc-disc-copy-)**
###### These instructions are for use with a PSN digital copy of the game contents of NCAA Football 14 (game ID NPUB31137). Only use these instructions if you bought the game from the PSN Store.

3) Install your game by opening RPCS3 and then dragging and dropping the game PKG into the main window. It will take a few minutes to install. Then place your RAP (license) files in `dev_hdd0/home/00000001/exdata`. If any of this is confusing to you, make sure you have followed the [RPCS3 guide to get your game PKG and license files](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Dumping_PlayStation_3_games#Dumping_PSN_games). 
4) Next, [download the Easy Installer PKG file from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176C-03J_yBKw--mgU4Z8hMEuic6ECWtR/view?usp=sharing).

## PS3 (Disc Copy) <img width="40" src="https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/playstation-png-logo/navy-playstation-png-logo-5.png">
###### These instructions are for use with a disc copy of the game contents of NCAA Football 14 (game ID BLUS31159). If you already have HEN and multiMAN installed on your PS3, you can skip to step 2. If you have also copied your disc to your PS3's hard drive already while installing prior mods, you can skip all the way ahead to step 5.

#### Prerequisites
You will need a PS3 console (any model), a USB drive (8 GB or larger), some kind of computer (any Windows PC, Mac, or even Chromebook will work) and either a game disc or a copy of the game files. Everything here is only needed for first time setup, aside from the console itself of course.

1) Follow [this great YouTube guide to install HEN and multiMAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOKemRHAZ3c) on your PS3. It should only take 30 minutes to an hour. **YOU CAN SKIP THE OPTIONAL STEP from 13:17-14:29**.
2) Start up your PS3 console and click the "Enable HEN" button (if it fails try again until it works). Then place your game disc in your console and launch the multiMAN application you installed earlier. 
3) Now, hover over the NCAA 14 icon and hit Triangle. A menu will pop up. Click copy, then click `PS3 HDD (/dev_hdd0)`. It will probably ask you "Do you want to copy the game from BD-ROM to internall HDD?". Select "yes".
4) This should take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to copy all the files over. Once it is done, you can click Square to continue. Then eject your disc (you will never need your disc again, you can keep it in the case forever) and quit out of multiMAN. If you got an error saying the process was aborted, please clean your disc and try again. 
5) Move over to your computer and download both [**PART ONE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fE0pmqJT-WBmQgs7lo6Ejbiv90f8YTll/view?usp=sharing) and [**PART TWO**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zkbzUV4XnslOxmI8ubNNJAtdEJfGCAqP/view?usp=sharing) of the V2 Easy Installer. Drag and drop both files onto the root of your USB drive (this means they should not be inside any folder).
6) Plug your USB drive into your PS3, navigate to the game tab on the main menu, scroll down to the bottom, and open the "Package Manager". Then click "Install Package Files". Then click "Standard". You should now see files called `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V2 Part 1.pkg` and `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V2 Part 2.pkg`. Select Part 1 and wait for it to finish installing, then select part 2 and wait for that to finish installing. Please note part 1 will take longer than part 2.
7) Once both parts are finished installing, you can remove the USB drive. **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY EJECTED YOUR GAME DISC**. Now launch multiMAN. Simply launch the game by pressing X. It will kick you back out to the main PS3 menu, but you wil see a disc icon even though there is no disc inserted. Simply click on that disc icon and it will launch NCAA 14 with our mods installed!

2) Make sure your game is downloaded to your console as it would be normally if you wanted to play it.
3) Move over to your computer and download both [**PART ONE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Daf6CYfdJbfnogJ7TjLuhzHi2CpTAVAI/view?usp=sharing) and [**PART TWO**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16F7Jr2CKms8qqBKFLikvxnx4hCxHjtbU/view?usp=sharing) of the V2 Easy Installer.

5) Once both parts are finished installing, you can remove the USB drive. You should now see a CFBR logo instead of the typical NCAA 14 icon. Launch the game like normal and enjoy the mods!

## XBOX 360 (Digital and Disc Copies) <img width="40" src="https://i.imgur.com/FMNWebJ.png">
###### These instructions are for use with the XBOX 360 version of the game. We apologize in advance for a lack of detailed instructions for XBOX 360 users. In all honesty, you're lucky to be getting an XBOX port of the mod at all with how long the conversion process is. We are working on a YouTube tutorial and will have updated instructions on this page soon, so look out for both of those. Also please note the Florida 2018 Homecoming and Texas A&M 2018 Throwback uniforms have some bugs right now, so please try to avoid using those two sets. This will be fixed soon, but we wanted to put out an XBOX port the same day we released PS3 and PC installers.
###### If you already have the game in XEX format, you can skip to step 2.
#### Prerequisites
You will need a USB drive (8 GB or larger). You will also need an XBOX 360 console with a JTAG or RGH installed. This requires soldering, so we recommend sending your console into a send-in service. You can find these services on Google or even EBay. They usually only cost around $50. Simply search "JTAG RGH service" and pick any site that pops up.

1) Download [Velocity-XEXISO here](https://github.com/Gualdimar/Velocity/releases/download/master28.10.2016/Velocity-master28.10.2016.rar) on your computer. Extract the program (with 7zip or Winrar) and run it. Take your ISO or GOD file and drag it into the window. Then select all the files, right click, and extract all to a new folder (this will be your game folder).
2) Make sure your game folder is on your USB drive. Download all four files ([File 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hA2C8dVIxexBUCjE0jdOCQ5jj9n8xwBs/view?usp=sharing), [File 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JoUKxakfGvQqhAh08luLV_YuBBRfnfy/view?usp=sharing), [File 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6WNRX8a8fmO2yAnKsKkwv0XtqQAh8qm/view?usp=sharing), and [File 4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F13DUoTW9Op-6sy_BoMdHFo-Y4yHleUz/view?usp=sharing)). Drag each one into your game folder to replace the original game files. 
3) Now simply place your USB back in your XBOX 360. Either launch the game from your USB or copy the game files to your internal hard drive to launch from there and enjoy the mods!
