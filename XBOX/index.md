## THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR V2 OF THE CFBR XBOX 360 MOD. THE XBOX VERSION OF THE V3 MOD IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WE WILL BE RELEASING IT IN THE COMING WEEKS.

---------
## Please uninstall any uniform packs when using this mod
We will fix this in the future, but for now, using uniform packs with our mod may cause issues with uniforms appearing correctly.

---------
## Rosters
For the best experience, download the latest roster from **OutrunFire0290**. This roster is specifically designed and optimized for the College Football Revamped Mod. Special thanks to Vikesfan and his team for making great rosters year after year over on the Operation Sports forums.

- The latest roster updates can be found here, as well as the offline file can be found [here](https://forums.operationsports.com/forums/ncaa-football-rosters/964552-ncaa-football-14-2020-2021-roster-update.html)

## Notes:
- These instructions are for use with the XBOX 360 version of the game.
- We apologize in advance for a lack of detailed instructions for XBOX 360 users. In all honesty, you're lucky to be getting an XBOX port of the mod at all with how long the conversion process is. We are working on a YouTube tutorial and will have updated instructions on this page soon, so look out for both of those.
- Also please note the Florida 2018 Homecoming and Texas A&M 2018 Throwback uniforms have some bugs right now, so please try to avoid using those two sets. This will be fixed soon, but we wanted to put out an XBOX port the same day we released PS3 and PC installers.
---------

### Prerequisites:
- XBOX 360 console with a JTAG or RGH installed
-- This requires soldering, so we recommend sending your console into a send-in service. You can find these services on Google or even eBay. They usually only cost around $50. Simply search "JTAG RGH service" and pick any site that pops up.
- USB drive (8 GB or larger)
- Some kind of computer (any Windows PC, Mac, or even Chromebook will work)

Everything here is only needed for first time setup, aside from the console itself of course.

## XBOX 360 (Disc and Digital Copy) Download Instructions:
1) Download [Velocity-XEXISO here](https://github.com/Gualdimar/Velocity/releases/download/master28.10.2016/Velocity-master28.10.2016.rar) on your computer. Extract the program (with 7zip or Winrar) and run it. Take your ISO or GOD file and drag it into the window. Then select all the files, right click, and extract all to a new folder (this will be your game folder).
2) Make sure your game folder is on your USB drive. Download all four files ([File 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hA2C8dVIxexBUCjE0jdOCQ5jj9n8xwBs/view?usp=sharing), [File 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JoUKxakfGvQqhAh08luLV_YuBBRfnfy/view?usp=sharing), [File 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6WNRX8a8fmO2yAnKsKkwv0XtqQAh8qm/view?usp=sharing), and [File 4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F13DUoTW9Op-6sy_BoMdHFo-Y4yHleUz/view?usp=sharing)). Drag each one into your game folder to replace the original game files. 
3) Now simply place your USB back in your XBOX 360. Either launch the game from your USB or copy the game files to your internal hard drive to launch from there and enjoy the mods!
